look at a Problem --> find a solution --> create a flowchart or pseudocode for the problem -->
it will be a rough solution --> build a program for problem that will be high level language --> as the language is high level language make it machine understandable.

for saving changes in git file inside vscode 
1) git add .
2) git commit -m "your message"
3) git push 

flowchart --> diagramatic approach of our solution.
terminator --> start and end (_)
input/output --> /_/
process --> simple rectangle
decision making --> diamond
arrows for the connector


Pseudocode --> way of generic representation of logic

Loops 

prime number
A number is said to be prime when it gets divided by 1 and the number
itself. for applying logic we check like if we have n=5
then from 2 to n-1 i.e upto 4 it's remainder should not be
zero otherwise it's not a prime number.
eg:- 5%2=1, 5%3=2, 5%4=1 hence none of the remainder is 0
hence number 5 is prime.

what is programming language?
A programming language is a set of rules and instructions that a 
computer can understand and execute. It is a way of communicating
with a computer in order to get it to perform a specific task.

why we need programming language?
we need programming language just to convert our human interpretable language
into the machine understandable language.
