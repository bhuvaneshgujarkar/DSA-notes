****LECTURE 1****
look at a Problem --> find a solution --> create a flowchart or pseudocode for the problem -->
it will be a rough solution --> build a program for problem that will be high level language --> as the language is high level language make it machine understandable.

for saving changes in git file inside vscode 
1) git add .
2) git commit -m "your message"
3) git push 

flowchart --> diagramatic approach of our solution.
terminator --> start and end (_)
input/output --> /_/
process --> simple rectangle
decision making --> diamond
arrows for the connector


Pseudocode --> way of generic representation of logic

Loops 

prime number
A number is said to be prime when it gets divided by 1 and the number
itself. for applying logic we check like if we have n=5
then from 2 to n-1 i.e upto 4 it's remainder should not be
zero otherwise it's not a prime number.
eg:- 5%2=1, 5%3=2, 5%4=1 hence none of the remainder is 0
hence number 5 is prime.

what is programming language?
A programming language is a set of rules and instructions that a 
computer can understand and execute. It is a way of communicating
with a computer in order to get it to perform a specific task.

why we need programming language?
we need programming language just to convert our human interpretable language
into the machine understandable language.

compiler 
it is a translator.
it finds error.

we use << in cpp to write our program.
; this denotes line end.






****LECTURE 2****
Data types and variables.
int - 4 byte/ 2 byte i.e 32 bits/64 bits
char -  1 byte i.e 8 bits
bool - 1 bits
float - 8 byte i.e 64 bits
double - same as float

how data is stored?
the number that has been entered is converted into binary
for eg: 8 --> 1000 this is 4 bit and then it is converted 
into storage i.e as we know 4 byte = 32 bit
so it will be 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000
in this form it is stored in the memory.

then about char as we know char is of 1 byte and for eg: if we
consider char as 'a' then it's ascii is 97. now this 97 
is converted into binary value and then it is stored in 8 bits table just like int.

compiler will identify value by data type.

typecasting --> process of converting value of one data type to another data type.

max value that can be stored in integer is 2^32-1
as it has 32 bit hence it can store 2^32-1.
and min value will be 0.

max value that can be stored in char is 2^8-1.

how negative numbers are stored?
at first it looks for first bit of storage.
i.e if number is positive then it start with 0 else it starts
with 1. 
eg:- -5 1) ignore the -ve sign.
2) convert into binary(101)
3) take 2's compliment

Operators:-
+ , -, *, /.
int/int = int
float/int = float
double/int = double

Relational operators:
=, >, <, >=, <=, !=

Logical operators:
&&, ||, !







****LECTURE 3****
Conditionals and Loops
if Condition

if(condition)
{
    --------
    --------
}

if-else
if(condition)
{
    ------
    ------
}
else
{
    ------
    ------
}

cin>>n; here cin is the function that stores 
variables and wait to get input value for that variable.
